# D-ALS
D-ALS stands for Drone-Assisted Landing System.
First of all this is a University Project under the supervision of Angelos Antonopoulos and Theofilos Chanialakis, TUC, Chania, Crete. In this project we try to make a quad-copter(Drone) land on its own just by staring a base thru a fixed camera.

By using OpenCV 2.4.10 every frame from our drone-mounted camera is being processed in order to be determined the location and the orientation of the base.

#The Base
The base will be represented as three points in a Î“ pattern (like QR Contours: Top,Right,Bottom). Those points' shape should be spherical show that they are multi-angle recognisable.
